        I think that Tesla and Boeing will go down in the stock market due to their performance.
        Tesla hasn't been doing the best with their Tesla Cybertruck and car sales, which they resolved by lowering prices.
        Boeing has been getting a lot of attention but for all the wrong reasons, and the workers are on strike as well, barely finishing up on a deal.
        The people who buy puts will be printing money, and I will be surprised if it goes up instead of down.

        CSGO major tournaments are better than any other esports tournament.
        The hype there is and how intense the matches are since they are almost equally matched, but there is always a shining star like S1mple.
        The player base makes it a lot better since everyone is hyped to see their favorite team on stage.
        We have seen many memorable moments in the CSGO scene that we haven't seen in any other game since the game goes all the way back to 2013.
